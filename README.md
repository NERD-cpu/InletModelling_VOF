# InletModelling_VOF

This repository contains the complete model used to define a transient inlet boundary condition to be used in a subsequent Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) simulation. The model constructs a virtual pre-domain in front of the actual domain's inlet and subsequently fills the pre-domain - initially filled with liquid - with gas bubbles of arbitrary shape and of random size, at a randomly chosen position in time and space. The complete user manual is also given in this repository; this a technical manual, without explanation of the concept behind the model or the underlying algorithm. The latter are described in my Ph.D. dissertation, published in 2O2O at Ghent University. You cand find the full text here: .... The user manual is also in the appendix of my dissertation.
